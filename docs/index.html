          5 Reasons Why You Should Learn How To Play The Guitar
        </h1>
        <!-- Reasons to play the guitar -->

              <h4>1. Improve Memory and Increase Cognitive Abilities</h4>
              <p>
                Most of us have heard that musicians are smart people but if you are like me i just thought they were always smart (maybe...not sure). Then i found out that playing a musical instrument (not just the guitar) improves your grey matter in the brain because you are constantly learning each day,new notes,tabs,music piece and that is good for your brain and memory.
              </p>

              <h4>2. Stress Reliver</h4>
              <p>
                We have all been there, you had a tough day. Maybe it was at work or maybe you had an argument with your partner. Stress isn't good for you as an individual cause it ages you quickly and can lead to even heart attacks. A lot of people listen to relatable music in order to cope with stress and just escape and there have been scientific studies to support listening to music decreases stress but you know whats better than listening to music ? Playing that said music. You personally get to express yourself through your own music of how you feel and it can be very therapeutic.

              <h4>3. Improve Motor Skills</h4>
              <p>
                Just like video games playing the guitar is very good for your motor skills and hand-to-eye coordination (or is it eye-to-hand ?) but unlike video games the guitar has no negative effects for playing for long periods of time cause you can play sitting down or standing up and the skills you acquire playing the guitar are transferrable to other activities you may do in your life.

              <h4>4. Gain Confidence</h4>
              <p>
                If you are socially awkward then learning how to play the guitar is gonna help you become more confident and increase your social skills. How? you might add, Well once you start learning the guitar you are going to learn songs then some of your friends and family are going to ask you to play for them and you will be embarrassed but you will do it. They will give you encouragement and feedback which will boost your confidence then you will learn more songs and play for more poeple then one day you will realize that you are not afraid to be in front and around people anymore.

              <h4>Chick's Dig It</h4>
              <p>
                I mean need i say more on this one ? Women like guitar players (musicians in general). Why you may ask ? Well thats because women just like men who have interesting hobbies and activities its not really exclusive of the guitar it could be sports,music,art,photography,animations,video editing, writing as long as you are not the typical i work,i watch sports and drink beer kinda of guy then you are golden. If you are women reading this then God bless you.

        <p class="intro__lead">
          Those are just some of the many benefits you get from playing the guitar so i hope you are motivated now and you are not going to back out from investing into learning to play the acoustic guitar. Now that is out of the way is time to actually look at the guitars and they are arranged by price from the lowest to the highest.
